# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the comprehensive review and error correction of the Galpones (Guinea Pig Housing) module in the SUMAQ UYWA system. The module manages housing facilities including galpones (barns) and jaulas (cages) for guinea pig inventory management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Galpones module to be free of TypeScript compilation errors, so that the application builds successfully without warnings or failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Galpones module is compiled THEN it SHALL not produce TypeScript errors
2. WHEN type definitions are used THEN they SHALL be correctly imported and applied
3. WHEN API responses are handled THEN they SHALL have proper type safety

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Galpones module components to follow React best practices, so that the code is maintainable and follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSX elements are rendered THEN they SHALL be properly structured without syntax errors
2. WHEN hooks are used THEN they SHALL follow React hooks rules and patterns
3. WHEN state management is implemented THEN it SHALL use appropriate React patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Galpones backend services to handle errors properly, so that the API is robust and provides meaningful error responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations fail THEN the service SHALL handle errors gracefully
2. WHEN validation fails THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be returned
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL return consistent response formats

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Galpones module functionality to work correctly, so that I can manage housing facilities for guinea pigs effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new galpón THEN it SHALL be saved with all required information
2. WHEN I manage jaulas within a galpón THEN the capacity and occupancy SHALL be tracked accurately
3. WHEN I view galpón statistics THEN the data SHALL be current and accurate
