# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the JSX syntax error in the CuyesManagerFixed component where adjacent JSX elements are not properly wrapped, causing a compilation error.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CuyesManagerFixed component to compile without JSX syntax errors, so that the application can build successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CuyesManagerFixed component is compiled THEN it SHALL not produce JSX syntax errors
2. WHEN adjacent JSX elements exist THEN they SHALL be wrapped in a JSX fragment or container element
3. WHEN the component renders THEN it SHALL maintain the same visual layout and functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix all JSX syntax issues in the component, so that the code follows React best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSX elements are adjacent THEN they SHALL be wrapped in React.Fragment or <> syntax
2. WHEN the fix is applied THEN the component SHALL maintain all existing props and functionality
3. WHEN the component is tested THEN it SHALL render correctly without visual changes# Requirements Document
