# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Optimize backend database queries and implement efficient data fetching
  - Replace multiple separate Prisma queries with single optimized queries using includes
  - Implement cursor-based pagination for better performance with large datasets
  - Add query result caching for frequently accessed reproduction data
  - Optimize statistics queries using Prisma aggregations instead of multiple calls
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [x] 2. Enhance validation system with Zod schemas and structured error handling
  - Create comprehensive Zod schemas for all reproduction form inputs
  - Implement structured error response format with field-specific validation messages
  - Add proper TypeScript typing throughout the reproduction module
  - Create centralized error handling middleware for consistent error responses
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [x] 3. Implement basic caching layer for improved performance
  - Set up in-memory caching service for reproduction statistics and animal lists
  - Add cache invalidation logic for data consistency when records are modified
  - Implement cache warming for critical reproduction data on application startup
  - Add cache performance monitoring and hit/miss ratio tracking
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 4. Improve responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop compatibility
  - Update reproduction forms to be touch-friendly with appropriate input sizes
  - Implement responsive table layouts with horizontal scrolling for mobile devices
  - Optimize button and interaction sizes for different device types
  - Add responsive grid layouts that adapt to available screen space
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [x] 5. Clean up code and implement TypeScript best practices
  - Remove unused imports, variables, and dead code from reproduction components
  - Replace any 'any' types with proper TypeScript interfaces and types
  - Refactor service functions to have single responsibility and clear purposes
  - Add comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 6. Add performance monitoring and testing infrastructure
  - Implement query performance monitoring for slow query detection
  - Add unit tests for optimized service functions with proper mocking
  - Create integration tests for cache operations and invalidation logic
  - Set up performance benchmarks for frontend component rendering
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation and performance tracking_
