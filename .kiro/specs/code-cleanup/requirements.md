# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the comprehensive cleanup and organization of the SUMAQ UYWA codebase. The project has accumulated duplicate files, obsolete code, temporary scripts, and unused components that need to be identified and removed to improve maintainability and performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and remove duplicate files and code, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN I SHALL identify all duplicate files with similar names or functionality
2. WHEN finding duplicate components THEN I SHALL determine which version is actively used and remove obsolete ones
3. WHEN reviewing backup files THEN I SHALL remove temporary backups that are no longer needed
4. WHEN examining similar functionality THEN I SHALL consolidate duplicate code into reusable components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove obsolete and unused files, so that the project structure is clean and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for unused imports THEN I SHALL identify and remove imports that are not being used
2. WHEN reviewing components THEN I SHALL identify components that are not referenced anywhere in the codebase
3. WHEN examining scripts THEN I SHALL remove temporary scripts and test files that are no longer needed
4. WHEN checking configuration files THEN I SHALL remove obsolete configuration files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to organize and standardize file naming and structure, so that the codebase follows consistent patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing file names THEN I SHALL ensure consistent naming conventions across the project
2. WHEN examining directory structure THEN I SHALL organize files into appropriate directories
3. WHEN checking component organization THEN I SHALL ensure components are properly categorized
4. WHEN reviewing imports THEN I SHALL standardize import paths and remove circular dependencies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and remove dead code, so that the application is optimized and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing functions THEN I SHALL identify functions that are defined but never called
2. WHEN reviewing variables THEN I SHALL remove variables that are declared but never used
3. WHEN examining routes THEN I SHALL identify unused API endpoints and remove them
4. WHEN checking database schemas THEN I SHALL identify unused fields and tables

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to consolidate similar functionality, so that code reuse is maximized and duplication is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN finding similar components THEN I SHALL create reusable components to replace duplicates
2. WHEN identifying repeated logic THEN I SHALL extract common functionality into utility functions
3. WHEN reviewing API calls THEN I SHALL consolidate similar API functions
4. WHEN examining styling THEN I SHALL consolidate duplicate CSS and styling code
