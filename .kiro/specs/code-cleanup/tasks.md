# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze project structure and create file inventory
  - Scan all directories and create comprehensive file list
  - Identify files with suspicious names (backup, old, test, temp)
  - Catalog all components and their locations
  - Map import/export relationships across the project
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Identify duplicate and obsolete files
  - Find files with similar names and functionality
  - Identify backup files (.backup, .old, .bak suffixes)
  - Locate temporary scripts and test files
  - Find components with "Fixed", "New", "Test" suffixes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Analyze component usage and dependencies
  - Map which components are actually imported and used
  - Identify unused components that can be safely removed
  - Find circular dependencies and resolve them
  - Check for unused imports in all files
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.1_

- [x] 4. Review and clean backend files
  - Identify unused API routes and controllers
  - Find duplicate service functions and business logic
  - Remove obsolete scripts and migration files
  - Clean up unused schemas and validation files
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 4.3, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 5. Review and clean frontend files
  - Remove duplicate components and consolidate similar ones
  - Clean up unused pages and route components
  - Consolidate duplicate utility functions
  - Remove unused styling and CSS files
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 5.1, 5.4_

- [x] 6. Consolidate duplicate functionality
  - Merge similar components into reusable ones
  - Extract common logic into shared utility functions
  - Consolidate similar API service functions
  - Create shared styling and theme components
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 7. Update imports and fix broken references
  - Update all import statements after file removals
  - Fix any broken component references
  - Update route configurations after cleanup
  - Ensure all API calls point to correct endpoints
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 8. Test and validate cleanup results
  - Run build process to check for broken imports
  - Execute all tests to ensure functionality works
  - Test application startup and core features
  - Verify no functionality was accidentally removed
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
