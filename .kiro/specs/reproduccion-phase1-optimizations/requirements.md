# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses Phase 1 immediate optimizations for the Reproduction module in the SUMAQ UYWA system. The focus is on technical improvements including backend query optimization, enhanced validation and error handling, basic caching implementation, and responsive design improvements. These optimizations will improve performance, reliability, and user experience without adding new features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want optimized database queries in the reproduction module, so that the system performs efficiently with large datasets and reduces response times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching reproduction data THEN the system SHALL use optimized Prisma queries with proper includes instead of separate calls
2. WHEN loading pregnancy lists THEN the system SHALL fetch related mother and father data in a single query
3. WHEN displaying litter information THEN the system SHALL use efficient joins to get all related data
4. WHEN querying reproduction statistics THEN the system SHALL use aggregated queries instead of multiple individual calls
5. WHEN paginating results THEN the system SHALL implement cursor-based pagination for better performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want robust validation and clear error handling in the reproduction module, so that I receive helpful feedback when operations fail and data integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting reproduction forms THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs with Zod schemas and provide specific error messages
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with actionable information
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight specific fields and provide clear guidance for correction
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly messages and retry options
5. WHEN concurrent operations conflict THEN the system SHALL handle race conditions gracefully with appropriate feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want faster loading times for frequently accessed reproduction data, so that I can work efficiently without waiting for repeated data fetches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing reproduction statistics THEN the system SHALL cache results for 5 minutes to reduce database load
2. WHEN loading animal lists for breeding selection THEN the system SHALL implement in-memory caching with automatic invalidation
3. WHEN fetching breeding recommendations THEN the system SHALL cache compatibility calculations for 15 minutes
4. WHEN displaying dashboard widgets THEN the system SHALL use cached data when available and fresh data when needed
5. WHEN data changes occur THEN the system SHALL invalidate relevant cache entries automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user accessing the system from different devices, I want the reproduction module to work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop, so that I can manage breeding operations from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing on mobile devices THEN all reproduction forms SHALL be touch-friendly with appropriate input sizes
2. WHEN viewing on tablets THEN tables and lists SHALL adapt to available screen space with horizontal scrolling when needed
3. WHEN using on desktop THEN the interface SHALL take advantage of larger screens with multi-column layouts
4. WHEN switching between devices THEN the user experience SHALL remain consistent and intuitive
5. WHEN interacting with forms THEN buttons and inputs SHALL be appropriately sized for the device type

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, maintainable code in the reproduction module, so that future enhancements can be implemented efficiently and bugs can be resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing backend code THEN all TypeScript types SHALL be properly defined without 'any' usage
2. WHEN examining service functions THEN each function SHALL have a single responsibility and clear purpose
3. WHEN looking at error handling THEN all catch blocks SHALL provide meaningful error information
4. WHEN checking component code THEN unused imports and variables SHALL be removed
5. WHEN analyzing code structure THEN consistent patterns SHALL be used throughout the module
