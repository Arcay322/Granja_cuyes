# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the TypeScript errors present in the frontend of the SUMAQ UYWA system. The errors include Material UI Grid component issues, type definitions problems, unused imports, and API response type issues that prevent the application from building successfully.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix Material UI Grid component errors, so that the application can build without TypeScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Grid components THEN they SHALL not require the 'component' prop for basic usage
2. WHEN Grid items are used THEN the 'item' prop SHALL be properly typed
3. WHEN Typography components use opacity THEN they SHALL not cause TypeScript errors
4. WHEN Material UI components are imported THEN they SHALL have correct type definitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix API response type issues, so that data from the backend is properly typed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API responses are received THEN they SHALL have proper TypeScript interfaces
2. WHEN accessing response data properties THEN TypeScript SHALL recognize the correct types
3. WHEN filtering or mapping API data THEN type safety SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN handling API errors THEN error types SHALL be properly defined

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up unused imports and variables, so that the code is clean and TypeScript warnings are eliminated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN imports are declared THEN only used imports SHALL remain in the code
2. WHEN variables are declared THEN only used variables SHALL remain in the code
3. WHEN TypeScript strict mode is enabled THEN no unused code warnings SHALL appear
4. WHEN building the application THEN no import/export related errors SHALL occur

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix type import issues, so that TypeScript verbatim module syntax works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing types THEN type-only imports SHALL be used where required
2. WHEN using verbatim module syntax THEN all type imports SHALL be properly declared
3. WHEN Material UI types are imported THEN they SHALL use the correct import syntax
4. WHEN custom types are exported THEN they SHALL be properly defined and exported
